### Secondary Theme
#### SPOOKY
Ghosts, ghouls, and goblins. Liminal spaces, analogue horror, gameboy terror. Strange things and unusual stories. It could be a scary horror, light-hearted haunt or a goofy ghost story. A tale of things that don't quite make sense. Maybe something weird happened to you and it's time to tell the story crouched around the glow of a gameboy screen.

This year we're getting a head start on Spooky Month. Make a creepy, uncanny, or unusual game for GBjam. Then refine it afterwards, ready for October.

What does SPOOKY mean to you?
